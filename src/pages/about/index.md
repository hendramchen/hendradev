**Hi, I’m Hendra** — a software engineer with over **ten years** of experience building modern, reliable, and scalable applications across the web, mobile, and desktop. I’ve worked as a full-stack developer for most of my career, and I enjoy turning ideas into real, high-quality products that people can actually use and rely on.

Throughout my journey, I’ve had the chance to work with a wide range of technologies: from crafting intuitive UIs with React and Next.js, to building stable backend systems using Laravel, NestJS, Node.js, and various cloud-based services. I love the balance between clean engineering and good design — writing code that not only works well, but is easy to understand, maintain, and scale.

This website is my personal space to share what I’ve learned. Here, I write about software development, architecture, best practices, problem-solving, real-world projects, and anything I find meaningful in the tech world. My goal is to help other developers learn faster, avoid common pitfalls, and build products more confidently.

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me experimenting with new tools, exploring AI technologies, polishing personal projects, or simply learning something new. I believe continuous learning is what keeps this field exciting.

If you’re a fellow developer, a potential collaborator, or someone curious about technology — welcome. I hope you find something useful here, and feel free to reach out if you want to connect or discuss ideas.
